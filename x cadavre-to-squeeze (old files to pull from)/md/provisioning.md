# Provisioning

To contribute to a decentral development of a commons for other economic knowledge and practice, the EML will endeavour to:
- initiate and support the development of an Economic Commons License (ECL);
- provision a registry of work released under the ECL;
- provision communication services in support of other economic projects.
