# About
The Economic Media Lab promotes the actualisation of postcapital network economies.

The EML curates, develops and produces [activities](activities.md) that promote creative and technical experimentation and development, and further public and specialist literacy and discourse. The Lab supports economic design work as well as policy advice.

The EML maintains the [EML Library](library.md), and provisions [infrastructure components](provisioning.md) that serve an [Economic Commons](economic-commons.md).

We work to base all our operations based on a privacy-respecting, preferably FLOSS [software stack](software-stack.html).
