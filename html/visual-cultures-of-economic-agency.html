	<h1>Visual cultures of economic agency</h1>
	
	<p>Documentation project of economies as cultures: Visible, situated forms of economic agency acting in coordination, in parallel, tangential to, or even in spaces other-than-capitalism. These operate at meso-to-micro scales where people cultivate economies as something they actively shape.</p>

	<p>These forms of economic expression exist in tension with capitalist ideals of standardization, streamlined communication and strict branding control. But as products and adds find their way into the streets of the world, and as they get used, sold, resold, stolen and refurbished, their identity shifts. Appropriation and interpretation of global branding is also an expression of economic agency, highlighting the tensions between global and local often with imperial and colonial implications.</p>

	<p>How to seed a landscape of economies beyond capitalism?</p>
